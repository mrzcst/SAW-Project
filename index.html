                <p>This is my website project for the incoming exam at SAW course. I had no idea about what kind of topic should I use for my website, so I decided to just make this demonstrative one, with no real purpose beside the exam. Beside the mandatory features for everyone that a website should have, there were some at choice and we should use atleast one of them, I am going with the Cart feature.</p>
